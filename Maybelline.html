           <h2> Maybelline History</h2>
           <p>
           <strong> Maybelline</strong> New York was born with a spark<strong> in 1917</strong>
             <br>when Mabel Williams singed her lashes in a cooking fireâ€” 
           <br>and turned disaster into opportunity by mixing the ashes with Vaseline to create a mascara product for all.
            100 years later, that Maybelline spirit lives on, in the spark and spirit of New York.<br>
            Every product we make lives up to our values: Diverse. Hardworking. No-hassle. On the pulse.<br>
             We create makeup that brings the fashion sensibility and pulse of New York City to the world.  
            This vision has propelled us to become the number one global makeup brand in over 120 countries. As our global community continues to grow, we are committed to helping everyone,<br>
             everywhere look -- and feel -- ready to take on their world.
